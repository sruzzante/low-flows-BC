Description
ParcelMap BC is the single, complete, trusted and sustainable electronic map of active titled parcels and surveyed provincial Crown land parcels in British Columbia. This particular dataset is a subset of the complete ParcelMap BC data and is comprised of the parcel polygons and attributes for over two million parcels published under the Open Government Licence - British Columbia.

This dataset does NOT include parcel representations (i.e. distinct polygons with unique PID identifiers) for Building Strata Parcels - Building Strata parcels are represented by a single polygon uniquely identified by the Strata Plan Number (i.e. individual strata lot PIDs are not included). For a dataset which includes unique polygon features (stacked geometries) for each Building Strata parcel, please use the ParcelMap BC Parcel Fabric or ParcelMap BC Parcel Fabric - Fully Attributed dataset or refer to the ParcelMap BC Shared Geometry Cross Reference Table, which includes the strata lot (PID) to strata plan relationship.

Notes:

Parcel title information is sourced from the BC Land Title Register. Title questions should be directed to a local Land Title Office.

The ParcelMap BC Parcel Fabric is expected to eventually replace the Integrated Cadastral Fabric.

Description
This is a province-wide SDE spatial layer displaying water rights licence data administrated under the Water Sustainability Act which includes data for both surface water and groundwater Points of Diversions. Point of Diversion types include Surface water Points of Diversion (PDs) Groundwater Points of Well Diversion (PWDs) as well as points of Groundwater diversion (PGs), non-well groundwater diversion points such as dugouts, ditches and quarries. This layer contains a record for each water licence on each POD type that exists in the province (each POD can have multiple licences). For each record, some basic information about the water licence is included.
